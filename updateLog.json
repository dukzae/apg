(school...) (exams...) i was unable to deliver. developing a new mode is almost like developing a new game, which is very hard to fit in one update. for that reason, there were an incredible amount of bugs, very limited content, and frankly, the mode itself was disappointing. for that, i deeply apologize. in a way it felt like i betrayed both the audience and also myself--and that's not really something that's easily forgiven.\n\nas much as i want to immediately fix these issues, it just doesn't make sense to focus all of my effort on this single mode for the time being--this is one of the struggles of being a solo developer‚Ñ¢. for that reason, i think disaster mode will be best vaulted for now and reintroduced as disaster mode 2.0 when the issues have been fixed. i want to cater this mode to be perfect for your playstyle.\n\nthanks for understanding, and happy plating! ‚òÄÔ∏è"
